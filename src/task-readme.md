I need you to build a simple tool which allows adding items (text boxes) to a list and then rearranging them using drag
and drop. There should also be a delete button next to each item to remove it from the list. There is no need for 
functionality to rename or in any other way alter added items.

Requirements:

- You can use any PHP framework you want for the back end, it does not have to be CakePHP. 
Something very light, like Lumen (the subset of Laravel) might be easier and more efficient to use.
 Framework must be a MVC framework though and task must be implemented using MVC logic.
 
- For the front end please use jQuery and jQueryUI, where you see appropriate.
- List of items (including their order) should be persistent and should be kept in a database table.
- There is no need for any styling, however layout of the tool must not break on small or large screens.
- Work should be uploaded to a github repository (will invite you to one),
- IMPORTANT: the tool must fully function without reloading the page (all actions must be ajax based).
 e.g. After adding new item to the list, it should be added without reloading the page.
 
- IMPORTANT: Please do this as if you were to pass it onto someone else to continue working on it.

What I would like to see from this, is not so much how well you can hack problems, but how good of a software engineer 
you are - that is: organisation, readability and extendability of the code is just as important as functionality.

And this is a part of the test:
- Give me an estimate for how long it will take you and when will it be ready. Of course, please take your time and 
if you are busy during the week, you can as well do it over the next weekend. Basically, set your own deadline and 
meet it (part of being a good software engineer is being able to plan your time after all).
